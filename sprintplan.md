Here’s a **detailed Agile Sprint Plan** for building a functional prototype of the **Local Deals platform (user + merchant side)** within a **3-hour sprint**. Since the time is very limited, this plan focuses on developing a **minimal but functional demo** that highlights the **core features**.

---

### 🕒 **Total Duration: 3 Hours (One-time Sprint)**

- **Team Size Assumed**: 3–5 people (PM, 1-2 devs, 1 designer, 1 QA/devops hybrid)
- **Focus**: Rapid prototype/MVP (not production-ready)

---

## 🛠️ Sprint Goal
To develop a working prototype of the Local Deals platform that allows:

- Shoppers to view and filter local grocery deals
- Merchants to log in and publish basic deal listings

---

## 📌 Sprint Structure (3 hours / 180 minutes)

| Time | Activity | Owner(s) | Output |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| 0:00–0:20 | Sprint Planning & Task Breakdown | PM + Team | Clear task assignments |
| 0:20–0:40 | UI Design for Shopper & Merchant screens | Designer | Figma mockups or HTML wireframes |
| 0:40–2:20 | Parallel Development | Developers | Basic frontend + backend |
| 2:20–2:40 | Integration & Testing | Dev + QA | End-to-end flow test |
| 2:40–3:00 | Demo Prep & Internal Review | All | Clickable prototype/demo |

---

## 🔧 Feature Breakdown by User Role

### 🛍️ Shopper App (Frontend MVP)

| Feature | Time Estimate | Notes |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| Home screen showing local deals | 30 mins | Static data or mock API |
| Deal filters (category, distance) | 20 mins | Dropdowns + basic logic |
| Deal detail screen | 15 mins | Price, image, expiry |
| Store profile view | 15 mins | Use static info for now |

---

### 🛒 Merchant Dashboard (Frontend MVP)

| Feature | Time Estimate | Notes |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| Merchant login screen | 15 mins | Basic email/password form |
| Deal creation form | 20 mins | Upload title, price, category |
| Deal management list | 20 mins | Display created deals |
| Store info setup | 10 mins | Static form, no validation |

---

### 🔙 Backend/API (Shared)

| Feature | Time Estimate | Notes |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| Basic data models (Store, Deal, Merchant, Shopper) | 20 mins | Use Firebase/Express/Supabase for speed |
| RESTful APIs (GET deals, POST deal) | 20 mins | Keep endpoints minimal |
| Basic auth for merchants | 15 mins | Use simple token or Firebase Auth |
| Sample data seed script | 10 mins | Populate for demo purposes |

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- Shopper can view and filter deals
- Merchant can create and view deals
- Demo includes 2-3 stores and 5+ deals
- UI reflects Local Deals branding
- All flows are clickable and integrated

---

## 🔄 Tools & Stack (for speed)

| Component | Tool |
|----------|------|
| UI/UX | Figma, Tailwind, Bootstrap |
| Frontend | React / Next.js / Vue.js |
| Backend | Firebase / Supabase / Express.js |
| Auth | Firebase Auth / Clerk.dev |
| Data | Mock JSON or Firebase Realtime DB |
| Dev Env | Vercel / Netlify for quick deploy |

---

## 📌 Post-Sprint Suggestions (Optional)

- Run user testing on prototype
- Document feedback + improvement areas
- Plan for future sprints (authentication, search, push notifications, etc.)
