## Overview

**Objective:**\
Local Deals is a two-sided platform (Mobile + Web) that connects small and medium-sized local grocery stores with nearby shoppers looking to save money on their grocery bills. The platform has two primary components:

1. A shopper-facing application to discover local deals.
2. A merchant-facing dashboard to upload, manage, and track deal performance, helping merchants sell featured, sale, and clearance items faster and reduce inventory waste.
